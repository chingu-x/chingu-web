          <Paragraph>
            You‚Äôll need, at minimum, basic HTML / CSS and Javascript skills to
            qualify for a Chingu Voyage. Know more than that? Chingu has got you
            covered: our Voyages have three different ‚Äútiers‚Äù separated by skill
            level (beginners, intermediate, advanced) so you can work in the
            Tier you are most comfortable in. We also run a Pre-work session
            once a month where members can discover what Tier they best fit in.
            <br />
            <br />
            TL;DR - We encourage people at any level (including beginners) to
            join, as our Pre-work program was designed to inspire / help people
            gain the skills they need to be eligible to join.{' '}

          <Paragraph>
            Yes, Chingu was designed for this. Companies want to hire
            experienced developers. If you successfully completed 4 Voyages,
            you‚Äôd have a robust portfolio, technical / soft skills, and 6 months

            Yes, every week we see members getting a job. Members who have

            job ready. They have gained the skills necessary to build multiple

            As for skill level, every new member has to complete a Pre-work
            project to be accepted to ensure they are ready. We run a 2 week
            pre-work session every month so you you find out if you are ready
            now. If not, you will be pushed to level-up your skills in the
            Pre-work to be ready for the next one. :)

            What happens if I don‚Äôt finish the Pre-work project or pass the
            qualifications?

          <Paragraph>
            No worries, we run Voyages every month so if you don‚Äôt pass the

            How much time do I have to commit?
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            We organize teams based on the people who join, and you‚Äôll be
            matched with people who have similar commitment levels to you. That
            being said, we consider part-time to be around 15 hours a week and
            full-time to be 25 or more hours a week.

            For you to get the full benefits, Chingu must be a priority during
            the duration of the Voyage program.

            Is the Voyage okay for Beginners?
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Yes. Even if you are not ready now, you will be after you gain the
            skills necessary to build the Pre-work project.

            What is the Pre-work session and Pre-work project?
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            The Pre-work session is where new members first join the Chingu
            community, find out which Tier they best fit in, and build a project
            from start to finish to ensure they are ready for the team Voyage
            project. The Pre-work projects are organized by Tier and typically
            to clone an existing website or app. When you join the Pre-work
            you‚Äôll be able to decide which project (and tier) best suits your
            current skill level.
